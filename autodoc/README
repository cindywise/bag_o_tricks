The files in this directory pertain to postgresql_autodoc tool.
http://www.rbt.ca/autodoc/

It creates a document of the databases, schemas, permissions, etc.

The files here are what I have changed to customize for Enova, as well as a few fixes.

After you download, make and install it, then you can overwrite the html.tmpl with this one.
The postgresql_autodoc is probaby not safe to overwrite, but you can see the diff to see what I changed to get things fixed and customized.
